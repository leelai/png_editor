## Technical Details

- **Pure JavaScript**: No external dependencies or frameworks

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure

- `script.js` - Image processing logic and UI interactions

## How It Works

The auto-crop algorithm:
1. Loads the image onto an HTML5 canvas
2. Scans pixel data to find non-transparent boundaries
3. Calculates the minimal bounding box containing all non-transparent pixels
4. Crops the image to the detected boundaries
5. Outputs the cropped result

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers that support:
- HTML5 Canvas API
- File API
- ES6+ JavaScript
